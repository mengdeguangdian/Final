How to execute my program:
You need to connect openmv and save main.py, then discharge the openmv. the openmv IDE will execute main.py automatically as background program.
Use VMwave command "sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0" to show the remoted UART infomation

The bbcar will detect the line on the ground, I use ROI=(5,90,180,30), as "find line.jpg" shows, the openmv will find lines in the lower half screen of camera
So it will not be disturbed by other lines on the background
Then the bbcar will circle around an object continuously till the ping detect something is closely(~20cm) in front of it
Then the bbcar will stop, it wait for an Apriltag in the camera screen to calibrate its direction
After the camera of openmv find the apriltag, it will print it on the vmware and go to the destination(Apriltag).
